Given a doubly linked list of size n, you have to delete the head of the linked list and return the new head.
Note: Please set the previous of new head to null, and set the next of old head to null, and then delete the old head.

Example 1:
Input:
LinkedList: 1<-->2
Output:
2
2

// Function to delete the head of the doubly linked list and return the new head
Node *deleteHead(Node * head)
{
   //Your code here
   Node *temp = head;
   head = head->next;
   head->prev = NULL;
   temp->next = NULL;
   delete temp;
   
   return head;
}
