Given a doubly linked list of size n, you have to delete the tail (last element) in the linked list.

Example 1:
Input:
LinkedList: 1<-->2
Output:
1
1

// Function to delete the tail (last element) in the doubly linked list
Node *deleteTail(Node * head)
{
   //Your code here
   Node *temp = head;
   while(temp->next != NULL) {
       temp = temp->next;
   }
   
   temp->prev->next = NULL;
   temp->prev = NULL;
   
   delete temp;
   
   return head;
}
