Given head, the head of a singly linked list, find if the linked list is circular or not. A linked list is called circular if it not NULL terminated and all nodes are
connected in the form of a cycle. An empty linked list is considered as circular.

Note: The linked list does not contains any inner loop.
Example 1:
Input:
LinkedList: 1->2->3->4->5
(the first and last node is connected,
i.e. 5 --> 1)
Output: 1

/* Should return true if linked list is circular, else false */
bool isCircular(Node *head)
{
   // Your code here
   if(head == NULL)
        return true;
        
    Node *p = head;
    do {
        p = p->next;
        
        if(p == NULL)
            return false;
    } while(p->next != head);
    return true;
}
