Given a circular linked list of size n, you have to delete the tail (last element) in the linked list.
In a circular linked list, the tail is connect to the head using the next pointer.

Example 1:
Input:
LinkedList: 1->2
(the first and last node are connected,
i.e. 2 --> 1)
Output: 1

// Function to delete the tail (last element) in the Circular linked list
Node * deleteTail(Node * head)
{
    //Your code here
    Node *p = head;
    Node *temp;
    
    while(p->next->next != head) {
        p = p->next;
    }
    temp = p->next;
    p->next = head;
    delete temp;
    
    return head;
}
