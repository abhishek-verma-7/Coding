Given a circular linked list of size n, you need to find the length of the list (total number of nodes). The tail of the linked list is connected to head.

Example 1:
Input:
LinkedList: 1->2->3->4->5
(the first and the last node is connected,
i.e 5 --> 1)
Output: 5

//Function to find the length of the Circular Linked list 
int getLength(Node * head)
{
    //Your code here
    if(head == NULL)
        return NULL;
    
    Node *p = head;
    int count = 0;
    
    do {
        count++;
        p = p->next;
    } while(p != head);
    return count;
}
