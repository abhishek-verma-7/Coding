Given a linked list of size n, you have to delete the head of the linked list and return the new head.
Note: Please also set the next of the original head to null.

Example 1:
Input:
LinkedList: 1->2
Output: 2

// Function to delete the head of the linked list 
Node * deleteHead(Node *head)
{
    //Your code here
    if(head == NULL)
    {
        return head;
    }
    
    else 
    {
        Node *temp = head;
        head = head->next;
        temp->next = NULL;
        delete temp;
        
        return head;
    }
}
