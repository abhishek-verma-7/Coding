Given a singly linked list consisting of N nodes. The task is to remove duplicates (nodes with duplicate values) from the given list (if exists).
Note: Try not to use extra space. Expected time complexity is O(N). The nodes are arranged in a sorted way.

Example 1:
Input:
LinkedList: 2->2->4->5
Output: 2 4 5
Explanation: In the given linked list 
2 ->2 -> 4-> 5, only 2 occurs more 
than 1 time.

//Function to remove duplicates from sorted linked list.
Node *removeDuplicates(Node *head)
{
    // your code goes here
    struct Node *current =  head;
    
    while(current->next != NULL)
    {
        if(current->data == current->next->data)
            current->next = current->next->next;
            
        else
            current = current->next;
    }
    return head;
}
