Given a linked list of size n, you have to delete the tail (last element) in the linked list.

Example 1:

Input:
LinkedList: 1->2
Output: 1

// Function to delete the tail (last element) in the linked list
Node * deleteTail(Node *head)
{
    //Your Code here
    Node *temp, *p = head;
    
    while(p->next->next != NULL)
    {
        p = p->next;
    }
    
    p->next = NULL;
    temp = p->next;
    delete temp;
    
    return head;
}
