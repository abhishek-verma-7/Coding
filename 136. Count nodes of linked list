// Given a singly linked list. The task is to find the length of the linked list, where length is defined as the number of nodes in the linked list.

Example 1:

Input:
LinkedList: 1->2->3->4->5
Output: 5

int getCount(struct Node* head){
    
        //Code here
        int count = 0;
        
        while(head) {
            count++;
            head = head->next;
        }
        return count;
    }
