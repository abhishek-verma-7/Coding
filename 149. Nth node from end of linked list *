Given a linked list consisting of L nodes and given a number N. The task is to find the Nth node from the end of the linked list.

Example 1:
Input:
N = 2
LinkedList: 1->2->3->4->5->6->7->8->9
Output: 8
Explanation: In the first example, there
are 9 nodes in linked list and we need
to find 2nd node from end. 2nd node
from end is 8.  

//Function to find the data of nth node from the end of a linked list.
    int getNthFromLast(Node *head, int n)
    {
           // Your code here
           int len = 0;
           for(Node *curr = head; curr != NULL; curr = curr->next)
                len++;
             
            if(len < n)
                return -1;
                
            Node *curr = head;
            for(int i = 1; i < len-n+1; i++)
                curr = curr->next;
                
            return (curr->data);    
    }
