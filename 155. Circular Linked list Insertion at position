You are given a circular linked list of size N. You need to insert an element data just after the given position pos.
The position of first element is 1. If the given position is greater than N, then don't insert anything as it is not possible.
As the given linked list is circular, it means that the tail is connected to the head of the list.

Example 1:
Input:
LinkedList: 1->2->3->4->5
(the first and last node is connected,
i.e. 5 --> 1)
position = 6, element = 10
Output: 1 2 3 4 5 

// Function to insert an element data just after the given position pos in a Circular Linked List
void insertAtPosition(Node *head, int pos, int data)
{
   //Your code here
   Node *temp = new Node(data);
   Node *p = head;
   
   int n = 0;
   do {
       n++;
       p = p->next;
   } while(p != head);
   
   if(pos > n)
      return;
      
    else if(pos == n)
    {
        p = head;
        while(p->next != head) {
            p = p->next;
        }
        p->next = temp;
        temp->next = head;
    }
    
    else 
    {
        int curr = 1;
        p = head;
        while(curr != pos) {
            curr++;
            p = p->next;
        }
        temp->next = p->next;
        p->next = temp;
    }
}
