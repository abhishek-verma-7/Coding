Given a circular linked list of size n, you have to delete the head of the linked list and return the new head.
In the circular linked list the tail of the list is connected to the head using the next pointer.
Note: Please also set the next of the original head to null.

Example 1:
Input:
LinkedList: 1->2
(the first and last node are connected,
i.e. 2 --> 1)
Output: 2

// Function to delete the head of the circular linked list and return the new head
Node * deleteHead(Node *head)
{
   //Your code here
   Node *curr = head;
   Node *temp; 
  
   while(curr->next != head) {
       curr = curr->next;
   }
   
   temp = head;
   head = head->next;
   temp->next = NULL;
   
   curr->next = head;
   delete temp;
   
   return head;
}
